# Project description

The initial idea of this project was to create a LLM based tool that can help conduct literature reviews. As technology advances at such a fast pace with a increasing amount of papers/books/research blogs published quickly, I'd like to use this tool to produce literature reviews on a subject I'm interested in to get a glance of the up-to-date research outcome and then point me to the ones that are worth reading in depth. 

There are applications that are already built to achieve similar objectives. However, I'd like to implement something myself to 1. meet my own requirements with the ability for adjustments and 2. allowe me to better test and understand the pros and cons of LLMs.

I will document the steps I took, the obervations made throughout this journey as well as useful resouces I encountered.
